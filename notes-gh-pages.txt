GitHub Pages Settings (Javascript implementation):
Go to your repo → Settings → Pages
Confirm:
Source: Deploy from a branch
Branch: gh-pages (not main or docs)
Custom domain: www.cbombs.com (should show "DNS check successful")

CNAME File: **
185.199.110.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.111.153
185.199.108.153

Ensure public/CNAME exists with exactly:
www.cbombs.com


# Working on project
npm run build && npm run deploy

(Only pushes the production-ready build/ folder to the gh-pages branch
Updates your live website (GitHub Pages)
Does not save your source code changes to GitHub)
Will have to update Github's settings->pages->custom domains, each time, unless having a public/CNAME file with url

# Pushing/Saving to GitHub
Can result in "404 File not found" error
May have to wait some time
*******
git checkout main
git branch -D gh-pages  # Delete local gh-pages
git push origin --delete gh-pages  # Delete remote again

# May need to recreate gh-pages if missing
...


rm -rf build/ node_modules/ package-lock.json
npm install
npm run deploy  # Let gh-pages package recreate the branch properly

Nuclear Option:
rm -rf node_modules/ package-lock.json build/ && npm install && npm run build && npm run deploy
